We’ve implemented a system that retrieves and analyzes user comments from YouTube, specifically focusing on the official trailer of a movie. Initially, the script searches for the official trailer using the YouTube Data API and collects a large number of top-level comments from the video. These comments are then organized chronologically and analyzed using sentiment analysis to understand how audiences were reacting prior to the movie's release—essentially capturing their excitement, expectations, and general mood based on the trailer alone.

To meet your new requirement of comparing sentiment or audience perception before and after the movie's release, we've expanded the functionality. The "before release" phase is handled by analyzing the trailer comments (as described above), while the "after release" phase is already in place, where we collect reviews or comments on platforms such as Rotten Tomatoes, OMDB, Letterboxd and TMDB.

By comparing sentiment trends from trailer reactions with those from post-release reviews, we can now offer meaningful insights into how audience expectations matched or differed from their actual experience with the movie. This comparison can focus on any key aspect—such as tone, enthusiasm, satisfaction, or specific themes mentioned in the comments. It provides a clear narrative on the shift in audience perception, helping you or your stakeholders better understand public reception at different stages of the movie's lifecycle.
